title: Why are you making money?

The other day a friend of mine held up a can of, I guess it was Bush's meat chili, and asked "How much money would I have to pay you to eat this?" I told him, "man, I don't want to eat that, I'm vegetarian!" And he said, "not even for a billion dollars? Imagine the good you could do with a billion dollars!" And that really stopped me. For a minute I started thinking of all the things I could do in the world if I had a billion dollars. Heck, I could make a pretty big impact on the political world if I had a billion dollars. I might be able to solve some of the big problems in my community and the world if I had a billion dollars.

But then I thought about it some more, and realized that I was letting my ends justify my means.  I was thinking that "once I have a billion dollars, then I'll be able to solve the problems of the world."  The problem is you can't stop there. Because you and I both know, a billion dollars won't actually solve problems in the world. In fact, it can make it a lot harder to solve problems, because your eyes just keep getting bigger and bigger, and to solve bigger and bigger problems you seem to need more and more money, and there's no place it ends.

When you start to think like that, it becomes very easy to forget to think about *how* you're making a billion dollars, and *why* you're making a billion dollars.

And looking at all these Wall St. bankers and businesspeople who are exploiting people so they can rake in more and more money, I have to wonder. Maybe a few of them just wanted to be rich and glamorous and didn't care who they steamrolled. But I like to think most of them just wanted to solve some problems in the world, and got so caught up in this spiral of greed that they forgot why they were making money in the first place.
