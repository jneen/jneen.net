## Summary
I am a musician, composer, and producer with extensive community experience in project, social media, and event management. I also have experience with platforming game design, and player testing. I also have a 15-year career in web services development behind me. I am a Swiss Army knife of skills, capable of wearing many hats, and would flourish in a small games studio.

I am a US citizen and permanent resident of Canada. I live in Toronto and am willing to work locally or remotely. I can accept payment either in CAD or USD, and require no additional visas to do work for US, Canadian, or other companies.

## Music Portfolio
I play piano and percussion. I have been making electronic music since 2014 in a wide variety of genres, mostly involving a fusion of retro game music, dance music, blues, and funk.

I tend to favour the more melody-forward style of game music over the more modern movie-ambient style. I am not afraid of loops. I have a background in jazz, marching percussion, and band arrangement, and a formal education in classical harmony.

A few selections from my discography:

* (2023) [**Super Mario Maker 2 (Banned Wagon Mix)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHEZNF0CSvs): A modern drum&bass / big-band arrangement of the Mario Maker 2 theme (featured on [OCRemix](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR04428))
* (2021) [**Froguelike**](https://soundcloud.com/jneen-collective/froguelike?in=jneen-collective/sets/spring-game-shorts): A fun, silly, and cute frog themed track composed for a game jam.
* (2022) [**Rhythm of the Mushroom Kingdom**](https://soundcloud.com/jneen-collective/rhythm-of-the-mushroom-kingdom): A funky disco-style track composed with AddMusicK for a SNES romhack
* (2022) [**Neon Chip**](https://soundcloud.com/jneen-collective/neon-chip): A classic house beat composed for a Geometry Dash-like game jam game.
* (2021) [**In Dreams, Held**](https://jneen-collective.bandcamp.com/track/in-dreams-held): A slow-burn electronic/acoustic fusion ballad that ends off my most recent [album](https://jneen-collective.bandcamp.com/album/the-longest-time)
