title: Using $HOME/.local
---

There are a lot of tools out there, especially for Mac developers, that are encouraging folks to change ownership properties on /usr/local.  [Homebrew][hb-ownership] does it, as well as popular dev packaging tools like [npm][npm-ownership] and [rbenv][rbenv-ownership]
